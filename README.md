Project Description:

Title: Secure Web Application with Spring Security JWT and Angular

In this demo project, I have developed a secure web application using Spring Security for authentication and authorization, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless security, and Angular for the front-end.

Key Features:

Authentication and Authorization:

Implemented secure login and registration using Spring Security and JWT.
Role-based access control to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.
JWT Integration:

Generated JWT upon successful login and included it in HTTP headers for subsequent requests.
Implemented token validation and renewal mechanisms to maintain session security.
Angular Front-End:

Developed a responsive and interactive UI using Angular.
Integrated Angular services to handle authentication and authorization workflows.
Implemented route guards to protect routes based on user roles and authentication status.
Backend API:

Designed RESTful APIs for user management and secure data retrieval.
Secured APIs using Spring Security to ensure only authorized users can access them.
Technologies Used:

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT
Frontend: Angular
Database: H2 (in-memory for demo purposes)
Tools: Maven, Postman (for API testing), Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA
